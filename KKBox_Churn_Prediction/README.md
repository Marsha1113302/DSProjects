# Predicting KKBox User Churn

This folder contains the work for my first Capstone. The goal of the project is to build a model that can predict user churn rate based of their transaction history, listening habits, and/or personal information. My approach comprises of three main steps:

  1. Clean and normalize data for analysis
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis
  3. Model building/Evaluation
