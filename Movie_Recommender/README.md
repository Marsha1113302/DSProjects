# Movie Recommender Website

This folder contains the work for my second Capstone. The goal of the project is to build movie recommender website from scratch. IMPORTANT: The user-item matrix was too large to upload on github. It is referenced in website/recommendations.py (left_matrix and right_matrix).

This repository contains:

* _Website:_ The website repository containing all Flask files for the application.
* _Notebooks:_ 
  * Content_with_EDA.ipynb for the Content-based filter.
  * Collab_with_user_scale.ipynb for the Collaborative-based filter and scaled by user.
  * Collab_with_movies_scale.ipynb for the Collaborative-based filter and scaled by movies. 
* _Presentation:_ Movie Recommender Project Presentation.pdf
* _Report_: Movie Recommender Project Report.pdf
